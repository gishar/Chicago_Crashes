# Chicago Crashes
This includes the work I plan to do on the crash/vehicle/people datasets from their [data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if). 
* My work will include some SQL work to practice my skills, clean up some data and maybe prepare dataset for the next steps: 
* I plan to do some data analytics through visualization (EDA) and then
* Conduct some data science task on it for crash count modeling, classifications possibly, etc. 

I think the above will already take several months with the time I can spare on these side interest but I like it and enjoy it anyway.
